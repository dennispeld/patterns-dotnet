# patterns-dotnet

**patterns-dotnet** is a simple .NET Core 3.1 console application to demonstrate some of the design patterns using C# language.

## Creational Patterns
- [Builder](Creational/Builder) (**Used for:** creating objects with many steps, where each step has a different implementation)
- [Factory](Creational/Factory) (**Used for:** creating related objects without specifying the exact class of the object) - **very userful**
- [Prototype](Creational/Prototype) (**Used for:** creating many similar objects) - **somehow useful**
- [Singleton](Creational/Singleton) (**Used for:** creating only one and only object)

## Structural Patterns
- [Adapter](Structural/Adapter) (**Used for:** adapting an old interface that canot be changed into new life) - **very useful**
- [Bridge](Structural/Bridge) (**Used for:** allowing many variations between implementations of abstractions) - **somehow useful**
- [Composite](Structural/Composite) (**Used for:** treating the same way different objects in a hierarchy) - **very useful**
- [Decorator](Structural/Decorator) (**Used for:** injecting new functionality into instances of objects at runtime rather than including that functionality in the class of objects) - **somehow useful**
- [Facade](Structural/Facade) (**Used for:** hiding complex implementations) - **very useful**
- [Flyweight](Structural/Flyweight) (**Used for:** creating lots of instances of the same set of objects and with that improving performance)
- [Proxy](Structural/Proxy) (**Used for:** controlling access to a particular object) - **very useful**

## Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Null Object
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
