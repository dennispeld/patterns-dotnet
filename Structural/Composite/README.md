# Composite

**Composite** is a design pattern, in which we try to give to a single object (or group of objects) an identical interface and have those
interface members to work correctly.

## Example
In this example, I want to create a ScrapbookObject that could be added to a Scrapbook later on. That object could be anything, a scribble,
a text, a picture, a sticker etc. In addition, I want to make sure, I can have a group of scrapbook objects I can add, too (not just one by 
one).
